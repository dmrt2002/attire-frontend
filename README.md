# A Strapi-powered E-commerce App with React and Redux - Attire

Attire is a full-fledged e-commerce application designed for selling clothes online. Built with modern technologies, it offers a seamless user experience for both browsing and purchasing clothing items.


### Backend:

Strapi: A headless CMS platform that provides a user-friendly interface for managing product data, including descriptions, images, prices, and inventory.

### Frontend:

React.js: A popular JavaScript library used to create a dynamic and interactive user interface for browsing products, adding items to cart, and navigating through the checkout process.

React Redux Toolkit: A powerful set of tools designed to simplify and enhance the use of Redux for state management in React applications. It builds upon the core functionalities of Redux while offering a more streamlined and developer-friendly experience.

I pushed my development skills further by successfully creating custom routes within Strapi.This enhanced functionality is available on the Strapi backend hosted on https://github.com/dmrt2002/attire-strapi
